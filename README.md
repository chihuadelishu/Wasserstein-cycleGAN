# Wasserstein-cycleGAN
Quick and dirty implementation of WGAN in pytorch derived from the pytorch implementation of cycleGAN with the Wasserstein Loss. Implements in pytorch both cycle GAN with clipping or differential penalty Wasserstein loss.

The original implementation is available here : https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

Just follow the instructions on this page to run this code, and enjoy !
